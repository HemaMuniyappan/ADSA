Explanation:

We use a dynamic programming approach where m[i][j] stores the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to compute the product of matrices from i to j, and s[i][j] stores the index k where the optimal split occurs.

We initialize the diagonal of the m matrix to 0 because a single matrix doesn't require any multiplications.

We iterate over the chain length (chain_length) from 2 to n - 1, where n is the number of matrices.

For each chain length, we consider all possible split positions (k) within the chain and calculate the cost of multiplying the two resulting subchains.

We update m[i][j] with the minimum cost and record the optimal split position k.

Finally, we reconstruct the optimal parenthesization using the s matrix.

Time Complexity Analysis:

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^3) because it involves three nested loops.
The space complexity is O(n^2) for the m and s matrices.
Efficiency for Large Instances:

This dynamic programming algorithm is efficient for reasonably sized instances of the problem.
For very large instances with a large number of matrices, the time and space complexity may become a limiting factor.
In such cases, more advanced optimization techniques or parallel computing could be employed to handle the problem efficiently.
